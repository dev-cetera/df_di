<!-- BEGIN _README_CONTENT -->

`df_di` is a lightweight, powerful "dependency injection" package for Dart and Flutter that makes your app modular, testable, and easy to maintain. It stops the confusion of finding and tracking services, like APIs or databases. With `df_di`, you store these services in "containers" that make them easy to access whenever you need them.

Why choose `df_di`? It‚Äôs inspired by [get_it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) but adds better type safety via monads provided by [df_safer_dart](https://pub.dev/packages/df_safer_dart), more robust async support, better debuggability and a very powerful `until` function that waits for dependencies to be ready, and much more. Whether you‚Äôre building a small Flutter app or a large-scale project, `df_di` keeps your code clean and your dependencies accessible.

## Quick Start: Managing a User Service

Let‚Äôs dive into a real-world example: managing a `UserService` that fetches user data. This shows how **df_di** containers shine in a Flutter app.

### Step 1: Create a User Service

```dart
class UserService {
  Future<String> getUserName() async {
    // Simulate fetching user data
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1));
    return 'Alice';
  }

  Future<void> logOut() async {
    // Simulate the logout process.
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1));
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Register the Service in a Container

Use a container to store the `UserService`. Here, we‚Äôll put it in `DI.global` for app-wide access.

```dart
import 'package:df_di/df_di.dart';

void main() {
  // Register the UserService in the global container
  DI.global.register<UserService>(
    UserService(),
    onUnregister: (result) => result.unwrap().logOut(),
  );
}
```

- **`DI.global`**: A built-in container for app-wide dependencies.
- **`register<UserService>`**: Stores the `UserService` instance, tagged by its type.

### Step 3: Access the Service Anywhere

Retrieve the `UserService` from the container and use it in your Flutter widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class UserProfile extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FutureBuilder<String>(
      future: DI.global<UserService>().getUserName(),
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
          return CircularProgressIndicator();
        }
        return Text('Welcome, ${snapshot.data ?? 'Guest'}!');
      },
    );
  }
}
```

- **`DI.global<UserService>()`**: Grabs the `UserService` from the container.
- The widget uses the service to fetch and display the user‚Äôs name.

This is the quick way, but it assumes the service exists. Let‚Äôs see a safer approach.

## Step 4: Safe Dependency Access

To avoid crashes if a dependency is missing, use `getSyncOrNone`:

```dart
void showUser() {
  final maybeService = DI.global.getSyncOrNone<UserService>();
  if (maybeService.isSome()) {
    print('Service found: ${maybeService.unwrap()}');
  } else {
    print('No UserService registered.');
  }
}
```

- **`getSyncOrNone<UserService>()`**: Returns `Some<UserService>` if found, or `None` if not.
- This prevents errors and lets you handle missing dependencies gracefully.

## Step 5: Hierarchical Containers

**df_di**‚Äôs containers can form a hierarchy, letting you scope dependencies. Built-in containers include:

- **`DI.global`**: For app-wide services (e.g., `UserService`).
- **`DI.session`**: For session-specific data (e.g., a logged-in user‚Äôs ID).
- **`DI.user`**: For user-specific data.

Child containers inherit from parents. Here‚Äôs an example:

```dart
void setupSession() {
  // Register a session ID in the session container
  DI.session.register<String>('session_123');

  // Access it from the user container
  final sessionId = DI.user<String>();
  print(sessionId); // Outputs: session_123
}
```

- **`DI.user`**: A child of `DI.session`, which is a child of `DI.global`.
- If `DI.user` doesn‚Äôt have a `String`, it checks `DI.session`, then `DI.global`.

You can also create custom hierarchies:

```dart
final featureContainer = DI();
final screenContainer = DI(parent: featureContainer);

featureContainer.register<String>('Feature data');
print(screenContainer<String>()); // Outputs: Feature data
```

## Step 6: Handling Async Dependencies

Need a dependency that‚Äôs not ready yet, like user data from an API? Wait for it with `untilSuper`:

```dart
Future<void> waitForService() async {
  // If UserService isn't registered yet, it will just wait until it finds one.
  // IMPORTANT: When using this function, make sure that XXX in untilSuper<XXX> is the
  // super-most class or matches the exact type registered. In the case of UserService,
  // this satisfies the requirement.
  final service = await DI.global.untilSuper<UserService>().unwrap();
  print(await service.getUserName()); // Outputs: Alice
}
```

- **`untilSuper<UserService>()`**: Waits until a `UserService` is registered in the container or its parents.
- Perfect for Flutter‚Äôs `FutureBuilder` to display data once it‚Äôs available.

## Step 7: Lazy Initialization

Save resources by registering dependencies that only create when needed:

```dart
DI.global.registerConstructor(UserService.new);

// This will create a new instance each time.
final a = DI.global.getLazySingletonSyncOrNone<UserService>(); // Created only now
final b = DI.global.getLazySingletonSyncOrNone<UserService>(); // NOT created again
print(a.unwrap() == b.unwrap()); // Outputs: true

// This will create a new instance each time.
final c = DI.global.getLazyFactorySyncOrNone<UserService>();
final d = DI.global.getLazyFactorySyncOrNone<UserService>();
print(c.unwrap() == d.unwrap()); // Outputs: false
```

- **`registerConstructor`**: The `UserService` is built only when first requested.

## Step 8: Cleaning Up

Remove dependencies when they‚Äôre no longer needed:

```dart
DI.session.register<String>('Temporary data');
DI.session.unregister<String>();

print(DI.session.isRegistered<String>()); // Outputs: true
```

You can also remove all dependencies all at once, i.e. when you log the user out of a session:

```dart
// This will unregister all dependencies in the reverse order by which they were registered.
DI.session.unregisterAll();
```
